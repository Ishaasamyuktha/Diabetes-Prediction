Data Analysis and ML Modelling of PIMA Diabetes Dataset
The following classification is done using PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset. Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes are metabolically characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, insulin secretory dysfunction, and increased rates of endogenous glucose production, which are the clinical characteristics that define this disease across most populations.
The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
